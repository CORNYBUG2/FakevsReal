# FakevsReal
This is my third-semester machine learning project. The project tells apart deepfake images from real ones.

I have used Google's TensorFlow Keras primarily for model training and other Python libraries like matplotlib, numpy, and pandas for Exploratory data analysis.

I got my dataset from Kaggle.

I've created 3 models here, all models are working with around 90 percent accuracy on the test set.

Model selection and testing completely depends on the images provided. Models may predict some images incorrectly.

This project is all open for suggestions. 

Thanks for reading this far. :D
